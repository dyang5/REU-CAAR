## Week 1

### <u>Day 1 (June 5th)</u>

Orientation and Introduction Day!
 - 11 AM - 12 PM: Bill Gasarch (program director) gave us a program overview and we learned about the other groups.
 My group members include SS, AF, and XG (initialed for privacy).
 - 1:30 - 4:00 PM: Met with Furong and Pan to discuss research goals for the summer. Since Furong is leaving for China in a few days, we laid out expectations for our project as well as started brainstorming ideas based on our group's interests and collective research experiences. Our preliminary ideas/thoughts include **concept-level fairness in LLMs** and **Fairness in Generative AI/Diffusion Models**.
 - 4:00 - 5:00 PM: Listened to Professor Victor Albert discuss the Quantum Error Computing Project

Socially, I ended up going to Target to get stuff for our suite, with one of program leaders and graduate students Auguste, along with SS, AZ, and AB. I then headed to the Gym to get a membership and play Raquetball with SS and AZ before heading to a late dinner with SS and AZ (after finding that the Student Union apparently closes at 4 PM).
