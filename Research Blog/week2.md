## Week 1

### <u>Day 8 (June 12th)</u>

Literature Review (pt. 5) & Finalizing Details
- 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM: We started off the day by discussing our project ideas further and continuing to read papers. My main goal today (which will continue into tomorrow) has and will be to type up the notes I've taken and to read the most relevant papers more closely. I'm quite happy with the progress I made on this front (the notes I have after today reach almost 8 pages). For email privacy concerns, I will avoid sharing the Overleaf document but will keep a running copy of the work we've done in the `Notes` section of this repo.
- 12:00 PM - 1:30 PM: This is typically our lunch break period, but today we had a group lunch hosted by the REU (Q-Doba) and listened to a talk by one of the mentors Laxman Dhulipala on his group's project "Parallel Algorithms for High Dimensional Clustering." I quite enjoyed the talk -- it was really fun to connect concepts I've learned in my Algorithms and Compilers classes and from my competitive programming experience.
- 1:30 PM - 4:00 PM: We wrapped up the day by doing much of the same work I did in the morning (again, will need to continue to do this tomorrow). We're hoping to finalize our talking points with Furong for tomorrow in preparation for an early Wednesday morning meeting.
