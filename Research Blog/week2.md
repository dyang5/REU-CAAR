## Week 2

### <u>Day 8 (June 12th)</u>

Literature Review (pt. 5) & Further Discussion
- 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM: We started off the day by discussing our project ideas further and continuing to read papers. My main goal today (which will continue into tomorrow) has been and will be to type up the notes I've taken and to read the most relevant papers more closely. I'm quite happy with the progress I made on this front (the notes I have after today reach almost 8 pages). For email privacy concerns, I will avoid sharing the Overleaf document but will keep a running copy of the work we've done in the `Notes` section of this repo.
- 12:00 PM - 1:30 PM: This is typically our lunch break period, but today we had a group lunch hosted by the REU (Q-Doba) and listened to a talk by one of the mentors Laxman Dhulipala on his group's project "Parallel Algorithms for High Dimensional Clustering." I quite enjoyed the talk -- it was really fun to connect concepts I've learned in my Algorithms and Compilers classes and from my competitive programming experience.
- 1:30 PM - 4:00 PM: We wrapped up the day by doing much of the same work I did in the morning (again, will need to continue to do this tomorrow). We're hoping to finalize our talking points with Furong for tomorrow in preparation for an early Wednesday morning meeting. Papers I took notes on today include the Generative Adversarial Networks, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model / Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model, Debiasing Methods Survey, and the Fair Diffusion paper. Tomorrow, I'll continue with the Adversarial Classifier, Debiasing Vision-Language Models via Biased Prompts, CLIP, and finish up the Debiasing Methods Survey papers for note-taking.

After research, I ended up checking out the Union's Campus Store (I'll definitely get something before the program ends) before eating at CFA with PM, MA, NL, DS, and ZS. I did some Codeforces before playing some board games with SS, AZ, AB, ML, and DS to round out the night. I went swimming this morning before research, and I felt that it was nice to wake up earlier and get some exercise in. In the future, I'll continue to do this as I can.

### <u>Day 9 (June 13th)</u>

Literature Review (pt. 6) & Meeting Prep
- 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM: After another morning swim (note: I'm happy I'm getting exercise in before research) and a quick breakfast from the IRB cafe (the second in as many days), the research day continued on like it has the last few days: more paper reading and LaTeXing my notes on the attached Notes document. At 11:00 PM, I Zoomed into to a PhD defense on "On Algorithms, Fairness, and Incentives" as it seemed relevant to some of the work we're doing in the REU and because I wanted to see what a PhD defense session is like (a few years down the line, I might be in the same position). While I wasn't able to follow as closely, I still think it was a worthwhile experience. 
- 1:15 PM - 4:00 PM: Since SS was working remotely today, we decided to spend the morning session a bit more focused on individual reading/note-taking. In the afternoon session, we were more focused on prepping our talking points for a meeting with our advisor tomorrow. At around 3:00 PM, we zoomed in with SS to discuss as a group before jotting down our main points for tomorrow. Hopefully the meeting goes well -- it would be sad to hear that the ideas we've been reading and thinking about for the last week and a half are not fruitful and/or attainable. That being said, I am sure the meeting will give us new direction into our project, which is an exciting avenue given that we've mostly been reading papers thus far.

After research today, I rode in XG's car as he went to get some gas, before driving to STAMP (Student Union) for some early dinner. Our research group had decided yesterday that we wanted to watch the new Spiderman Movie (Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse) and so we went to the theatre at 6 today to do so. After managing to convince another car owner at the REU and a few other REU participants, a large group of us (XG, AF, SS, me, PM, MA, JS, SK, DS, and NL) convened at the theatre and had a great time watching the movie. There was a bit of a debacle with the seats -- it turns out that when my research group ordered the tickets yesterday, we had actually ordered for 6 PM that day. When movie watchers came in and said we were in their seats, we were in a bit of a pickle. After a bit of shuffling at the start of the movie (and some manager assistance), we were relegated to the back of the theatre, which was a perfectly fine seating arrangement as we at least got to watch the movie. We came back and a subset of us played some Codenames. Definitely a fun experience and a crazy day.
