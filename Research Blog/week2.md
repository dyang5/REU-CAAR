## Week 2

### <u>Day 8 (June 12th)</u>

Literature Review (pt. 5) & Further Discussion
- 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM: We started off the day by discussing our project ideas further and continuing to read papers. My main goal today (which will continue into tomorrow) has been and will be to type up the notes I've taken and to read the most relevant papers more closely. I'm quite happy with the progress I made on this front (the notes I have after today reach almost 8 pages). For email privacy concerns, I will avoid sharing the Overleaf document but will keep a running copy of the work we've done in the `Notes` section of this repo.
- 12:00 PM - 1:30 PM: This is typically our lunch break period, but today we had a group lunch hosted by the REU (Q-Doba) and listened to a talk by one of the mentors Laxman Dhulipala on his group's project "Parallel Algorithms for High Dimensional Clustering." I quite enjoyed the talk -- it was really fun to connect concepts I've learned in my Algorithms and Compilers classes and from my competitive programming experience.
- 1:30 PM - 4:00 PM: We wrapped up the day by doing much of the same work I did in the morning (again, will need to continue to do this tomorrow). We're hoping to finalize our talking points with Furong for tomorrow in preparation for an early Wednesday morning meeting. Papers I took notes on today include the Generative Adversarial Networks, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model / Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model, Debiasing Methods Survey, and the Fair Diffusion paper. Tomorrow, I'll continue with the Adversarial Classifier, Debiasing Vision-Language Models via Biased Prompts, CLIP, and finish up the Debiasing Methods Survey papers for note-taking.

After research, I ended up checking out the Union's Campus Store (I'll definitely get something before the program ends) before eating at CFA with PM, MA, NL, DS, and ZS. I did some Codeforces before playing some board games with SS, AZ, AB, ML, and DS to round out the night. I went swimming this morning before research, and I felt that it was nice to wake up earlier and get some exercise in. In the future, I'll continue to do this as I can.
