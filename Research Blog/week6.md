## Week 6

### <u>Day 36 (July 10th)</u>

Week 6, Day 1

 - 8:30 - 9:00 AM: Week 6 here we go! Unfortunately, lane lines were being moved at the pool (again) and so my morning workout started closer to 8:40/8:45 than 8:30. Regardless, I managed to make the most out of the situation by going for 40 laps in just around 20 minutes, which is a much quicker pace (close to 2:00/100yd) than I have been going.

 - 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM: To start off this week, I wanted to wrap up my work with the confusion matrices that I've been coding (the confusion matrices show us which genders/races our classifier outputs compared to the true genders/races for all our images). Over the weekend, I was able to get the confusion matrices to show percentages, but I also wanted to show the raw numbers (in terms of how many examples it classified for each of the given predicted/true race and gender combos). In the morning, I managed to get the code working for our smaller testset example. As I've been doing throughout the last week, I always code up a sample, get it working on the testset, and then replicate the code for the entire FairFace validation set.

 - 12:00 - 1:00 PM: We had our weekly REU lunch talk. This time, Jim Purtilo, a Professor at UMD, talked about Software Engineering (what is it, what is important to succeed, etc.) and we got free catering from Q-Doba (note: important to get there early to make sure food does not run out). Overall, I thought it was a fun, interactive talk -- and the ideals stressed to succeed in Software Engineering obviously apply to research as well (effective communication)!

- 1:00 - 4:00 PM: The afternoon session was a bit less productive for me. I ran my updated confusion matrix code on my FairFace validation program, which takes a while. I've currently set it up so that the classifier results are saved in a CSV (so I can theoretically read the CSV for the results and save the time that the classifier takes to run on each of the 10,000 images in the FairFace validation set), but for now, I've just been running the classifier on the same set of images. I think this will change (the code to read the CSV is not terribly difficult) as I continue to run more tests, but since my work today essentially closed the chapter (for now) of testing the DeepFace classifier on the FairFace dataset, I will hold off on that front. Tomorrow, I'm hoping to start researching/looking into how I can implement the Linear Head approach I've been discussing throughout these notes. When I get the time, I'll also happily share the confusion matrices I generated (essentially the product of my last week and a half which is cool yet a bit sad as I think I could have done it faster) here.

After research, PM and MA finally decided to purchase gym passes (their timing lines up with the start of the second summer session at the gym, meaning they pay less than what most of us paid at the start of the program -- when it was the middle of the first summer session), so PM, MA, DS, SS, and I went to play basketball. SS wanted to get a healthier dinner (than CFA), so DS and I decided to join her at Yahentimisi, one of the main dining halls on campus, where we ran into CK. Afterwards, I went back to the dorm to relax, work on some CodeForces, and read. I'm starting the book "Atomic Habits," which my parents brought over per my request when they came to visit. I think it'll be good to get some reading in as it will mean less screentime before bed and more learning. 

### <u>Day 37 (July 11th)</u>

Week 6, Day 2

 - 8:30 - 9:00 AM: Got my morning swim in today, going for 50 laps in just under 30 minutes. My arms and legs felt like jelly after playing basketball and swimming yesterday, but it was good to power through this morning.

 - 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM: I was hoping to start working on the linear head approach today. I started working on a related topic (one that we need to have working before we can even train a linear head) by combining my work over the last week with our previous "detect and classify program." More specifically, we need to set up an image to classification pipeline which we will need to train a linear head. After running into some small errors, I took a break and joined the GatherTown (online environment where the virtual conference is held) for the [https://virtual2023.aclweb.org/index.html](ACL: Association for Computational Linguistics Conference), a conference that SS was planning to attend but cannot due to a visa situation. It turns out that another one of my friends who is a PhD student at UPenn is actually there in person as well, which is a cool coincidence. For some reason, the GatherTown is publically available, meaning I can interact with virtual participants/look at their posters; this was a nice "break" from research and it was definitely cool to look at all the work being done at this NLP conference.

 - 1:15 - 4:00 PM: I have to start by admitting that these last few afternoon sessions have not felt as productive as normal for me. After finishing up the image to classification pipeline that I had started in the morning (it was not too hard to fix this up), I mostly spent some time looking into how we can get Stable Diffusion (or really any other diffusion model) to run locally. The general pipeline we will need is Text-to-Image into Image-to-Classification into updating a Linear Head. Since we've solidified the first pipeline, we will need to work with the first one (Text-to-Image, essentially a diffusion model) before we start building out the third one.

 After research, I took a nap (my first one of the REU) before grabbing some CFA for dinner. There were plans to watch a movie earlier (but still after research) but nothing materialized, but after waking up from my nap, I tried to get something going. I ended up watching "Taken" with the typical group (SS, DS, and AB). Tomorrow night, we'll have a meeting with our advisor to update her on progress and to talk about next steps -- I think this will be really useful as I orient myself for the second half of the REU.
