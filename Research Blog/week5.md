## Week 5

### <u>Day 29 (July 3rd)</u>

Week 5, Day 1

This is now the 5th week of the program, which is crazy to think! Today, we have an unofficial day off from the REU and my parents came to visit which was fun. After waking up later than normal, I went for a morning 50-lap swim. For lunch, I met up with my parents and we went to a Steakhouse, which was quite filling. After showing them my dorm, I split off and tried to get some research done.

The most frustrating part is that the code I've written on my Jupyter Notebook still does not run using a GPU -- even after my group gave me some suggestions and it looked like it might finally work, it just still doesn't. I asked my advisor about this but it looks like I may have to move on for the time being and prepare for the presentation instead from tomorrow onwards. This really sucks because I spent about a week writing the code but now I don't even get a chance to run it. I hope a workaround/fix will come soon.

For dinner, AB, LH, ML, SS, ZS, SK, and two other non REU-CAAR students went to "Board 'n Brew" to celebrate a birthday (not saying who for privacy concerns). We played some board games (the place is known for board games and food) and had a fun time with a large group which is always nice. Tomorrow is the 4th of July; I don't have any crazy plans but will probably get both meals with my parents who are in town for a few more days. Other than that, I will hopefully have a lot of the presentation done/a fix to my Jupyter problem, but the latter seems relatively unlikely.

### <u>Day 30 (July 4th)</u>

Week 5, Day 2

Another day off -- this time due to the 4th of July! After another 50 lap morning swim (the pools were packed today due to Masters Swimmers and families celebrating the 4th of July... I guess), I met up again with my parents. We went to a seafood restaurant for lunch before heading back to their hotel to get some work done. I talked to them a bunch about grad school applications, my research project and the challenges/next steps (also showing them some of our group's presentations), and got a CodeForces problem done all in a few hours time. It was definitely good to catch up and to share what I've been working on and thinking about. I started working a bit more on the presentation we're scheduled to have on July 6th. I'm still pretty bummed about the GPU problem and my code not running but that will have to wait -- we may have a group meeting with our advisor tomorrow night (pending her reply) and we will certainly have to present Thursday morning, so these tasks take precedence.

For dinner, my parents and I went to "China Buffet" (it turns out finding a restaurant open on July 4th is quite difficult), which was better than expected. Afterwards, I got dropped back off at my dorms. My parents are staying a night or two more before going to visit my brother at his camp on the East Coast, so they will be doing plenty of traveling these next few days.

Despite potential Fireworks and S'mores plans being floated around by AG (our grad program leader), both plans ended up fizzling out (though we may do S'mores another time next week). I had a chill 4-day weekend but it'll definitely be a busy day at research tomorrow with the presentation/meeting prep.
