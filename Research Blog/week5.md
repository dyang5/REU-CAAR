## Week 5

### <u>Day 20 (July 3rd)</u>

Week 5, Day 1

This is now the 5th week of the program, which is crazy to think! Today, we have an unofficial day off from the REU and my parents came to visit which was fun. After waking up later than normal, I went for a morning 50-lap swim. For lunch, I met up with my parents and we went to a Steakhouse, which was quite filling. After showing them my dorm, I split off and tried to get some research done.

The most frustrating part is that the code I've written on my Jupyter Notebook still does not run using a GPU -- even after my group gave me some suggestions and it looked like it might finally work, it just still doesn't. I asked my advisor about this but it looks like I may have to move on for the time being and prepare for the presentation instead from tomorrow onwards. This really sucks because I spent about a week writing the code but now I don't even get a chance to run it. I hope a workaround/fix will come soon.

For dinner, AB, LH, ML, SS, ZS, SK, and two other non REU-CAAR students went to "Board 'n Brew" to celebrate a birthday (not saying who for privacy concerns). We played some board games (the place is known for board games and food) and had a fun time with a large group which is always nice. Tomorrow is the 4th of July; I don't have any crazy plans but will probably get both meals with my parents who are in town for a few more days. Other than that, I will hopefully have a lot of the presentation done/a fix to my Jupyter problem, but the latter seems relatively unlikely.
