## Week 3

### <u>Day 22 (June 26th)</u>

Week 4, Day 1

I can't believe we're already on the 4th week of this program...
 - 8:30 - 9:00 AM: Got out earlier than normal for my morning swim, but the lifeguards were doing some lane-line moving due to a swim group coming in before me. Unlike the previous lane-line shift, these lifeguards kept me out of the pool, and so I only got in 18ish minutes of a swim this morning. I was definitely a bit bummed about that but I can understand that the lifeguards are just trying to do their job.

- 10:00 - 11:30 AM: Shorter morning session today due to an earlier lunch talk. SS and I spent the morning working on incorporating our test set and modifying our program to run on a folder of images (mainly SS). Otherwise, I worked on a presentation for our meeting tomorrow night with our advisor, which summarizes the work we've been doing and questions we have.

- 11:30 AM - 12:45 PM: Daniel Apon, an Adjunct Professor of CS here who has done industry work in Post-Quantum Crytography, came in for a lunch talk today and talked about his career path, along with what he did in each of his roles at NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and MITRE. I thought the talk was quite good -- there was not much heavy theory but he explained the work he did/related concepts quite clearly. I find that many of these invited speakers are quite charismatic while being brilliant, and that's really cool to see. It was cool to also learn a bit more about Cryptography and his work, which was on the Applied Pure Math side -- something I might be interested in doing in my career as well.

- 1:00 - 4:00 PM: After modifying our testing program to run on a "test set" of images, we manually classified the genders for each person in our dataset. It turns out that SS's face detection & gender classification model has a 53% accuracy whereas my object detection & gender classification model has a 47% accuracy. These are obviously quite poor -- by straight up guessing, we might expect a 50% accuracy. We'll definitely need to present these results to our advisor and talk about potential fixes -- or test a separate gender classification model (or maybe even train our own). I'm not terribly worried about these numbers just yet since we are sort of just experimenting (and using pretrained models), but if the issues persist after a week or two, this could be cause for concern. Another small concern is that the detection model we are using, YOLOv8, is very well-known and widely-usde, but it seems like the creators of the model have not cared to write a paper about it or the architecture they use; this seems a bit weird considering their whole goal is to be open-source and advance AI detection models. We'll also need to ask our advisor about that. Near the end of the research day, I picked up a check from the REU for the first two-three weeks, which was nice.

Post-research, I had planned to go play tennis with NL and MA, but it was nearly 90 degrees out and way too hot for that. Consequently, I decided to go for another pool swim, which fits the weather much better. For some reason, I felt motivated to some "sets" (short but speedy mini-workouts) and was quite pleased to notice my general endurance/effort. Maybe all the exercise is paying off; I definitely feel good about where I'm at, but the swimming efforts show it too. I think this is definitely one + about a REU compared to research at a home institution -- at a LAC like Swarthmore, general resources are limited (athletic facilities, connection with other research students, etc.) whereas at a REU, all of these things are widely available. A bonus is the research of course, which hopefully will continue to go smoothly and successfully. For any interested readers, I would definitely recommend applying to REUs ASAP.
