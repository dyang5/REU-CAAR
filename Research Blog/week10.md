Week 10 Day 1: The Final Week

- 8:30 - 9:00 AM: As is tradition at the start of each week: Week 10 here we go! It's crazy to think it really is going to be the end of the REU in just a few days. I'm definitely going to try to make the most of the time we have together and also hopefully finish strong research-wise as well. To kick off this final week, I decided to go for a classic 2 mile morning run. Legs definitely felt quite tired with all the running/sprinting I did yesterday, but it was good to get a nice workout in. Since my group and I asked LH to be our "friend" (Bill wants all practice presentations to have a "friend" who has not seen our presentation to act as an unbiased, secondary feedback-giver along with Clyde Kruskal), she also asked me this morning to sit into her presentation. This meant that I had to shower quickly and head out earlier than normal to make sure I made it by 9:45.

- 9:45 AM - 12:00 PM: I made it over to the CSI building at 9:45, running in to LH along the way. There, I listened to LH, GP, and AZ's project presentation (Machine Translation for Wikipedia), which was quite good. Though this was their group's second round of feedback, Clyde gave pretty solid feedback on each of their slides -- so much so that he went 25 minutes over, leading to a slight delay for each of the next few groups. The MT group's talk went until around 11 AM, after which I promptly headed over to talk with my group about our project. I finished up one of the slides I was working on last night, and worked slightly past our typical lunch time. I totally forgot that Bill was hosting a lunch talk but that didn't seem to be a problem...

- 12:00 - 1:30 PM: Bill was scheduled to give his lunch talk "Trick Questions or Stupid Questions" starting at 12, but since the presentation groups got a bit delayed, we didn't start until 12:30. The talk itself was solid, as all Bill talks have been, and mainly consisted of him asking us math-ish riddles, giving us the answer, and then asking if the question was a trick or just stupid.

- 1:30 - 3:00 PM: After the talk, I went up to our conference room to get in some more work and finish up the presentation. Our big order of business this week is to deliver our final presentation Wednesday morning, so I've been doing what I can to make the presentation orderly and understandable. In the afternoon, this mainly consisted of adding animations to relevant slides, reorganizing details, and then doing a practice runthrough right before we were scheduled to present. The practice runthrough itself went to about 22 minutes, which is not great considering our presentation is supposed to be between 15 and 20. This was the first time we practiced as an entire group -- it has been kind of hard to get everyone together and actually go through with the presentation (and I get the sense the others care a bit less about it than I do); in the middle of our practice presentation, we also received an email from Bill that due to the schoolwide tornado warning, we were to head "home" and that our presentation (which was meant for the 3 - 4 PM time slot) would be rescheduled. This was definitely a blow to my group -- all other groups have already done two rounds of presentations with Clyde whereas we haven't even gotten a single one (due to AF being out last week and the tornado warning today). While I understand that Bill probably picked the 3-4 PM time slot for us since if we went over, we wouldn't delay the other groups' presentations, and that today's tornado warning couldn't have been forecasted, it just sucks that we haven't gotten any outside feedback yet/done any official runthroughs. (We are now scheduled for a Zoom one tomorrow at 11 AM, the day before our presentation, which is better than nothing at this point).

Per the tornado warning, most of the REU group congregated in my suite. We ended up talking for a bit and playing some Jackbox (online group game). For dinner, since the Student Union was closed, I made some Ramen and Soba (courtesy of a big package order from my parents) and then rejoined the group to watch some Kung Fu Panda. The night activity they were planning involved alcohol at the very least so I decided to hold off on that, and retire to my room to organize the presentation and work on some CodeForces. Looking forward to tomorrow -- hopefully we get some solid (I imagine it will be quite useful for us as well) advice on our presentation and that we clutch up for the big one on Wednesday! There are also rumblings of a plan to go to the beach post-research and that will be nice if it ends up happening...
