Week 10 Day 1: The Final Week

- 8:30 - 9:00 AM: As is tradition at the start of each week: Week 10 here we go! It's crazy to think it really is going to be the end of the REU in just a few days. I'm definitely going to try to make the most of the time we have together and also hopefully finish strong research-wise as well. To kick off this final week, I decided to go for a classic 2 mile morning run. Legs definitely felt quite tired with all the running/sprinting I did yesterday, but it was good to get a nice workout in. Since my group and I asked LH to be our "friend" (Bill wants all practice presentations to have a "friend" who has not seen our presentation to act as an unbiased, secondary feedback-giver along with Clyde Kruskal), she also asked me this morning to sit into her presentation. This meant that I had to shower quickly and head out earlier than normal to make sure I made it by 9:45.

- 9:45 AM - 12:00 PM: I made it over to the CSI building at 9:45, running in to LH along the way. There, I listened to LH, GP, and AZ's project presentation (Machine Translation for Wikipedia), which was quite good. Though this was their group's second round of feedback, Clyde gave pretty solid feedback on each of their slides -- so much so that he went 25 minutes over, leading to a slight delay for each of the next few groups.
