## Week 8

### <u>Day 50 (July 24th)</u>

Week 8 Day 1: 50 Days

 - 8:30 - 9:00 AM: It's crazy to think that I've been here for 50 days already. We now officially have just three weeks (more like two since the final presentation will be sometime during the last week), so hopefully my group can finalize some presentable results in the next two weeks (I feel good about the way my new Semantic Guidance approach is going). 
 
 I've been a bit lazier than I would like to be with regards to Monday and Friday workouts; from my experience, these are the days when the lane lines at the pools are being moved, and my pool workouts usually get cut in half because of this. I had planned to wake up at 8:30 to go on a morning run, but upon waking up, I made the decision to take the extra hour of sleep; as I figured out later, this may have made be more tired.

 - 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM: With the program ending soon and our advisor out in Hawaii for a big ML conference, it is really go time for our group, and it's kind of up to us to get as much done as we can. XG said he wasn't feeling good and couldn't make it in today, so it was me, SS, and AF holding down the fort. Continuing off my work from last week, I have been working on an approach that uses Semantic Guidance for fair image generation. This morning, I focused a bit more on actually getting individual fairness to work, and the success was noticeable, which is great! Though the approach for individual fairness is very similar to the one presented in the following [Fair Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10893.pdf) paper (hence why we want to focus on group fairness in this project), it is good to see some progress being made and for the images to be generally more fair. 
 
 - 12:00 - 1:30 PM: We had another Monday lunch talk hosted by Professor Jon Katz of UMD CS. Though Bill titled the talk as "Security and Crypto," the talk ended up being more about Jon's experience working in industry and academia. The talk itself was quite insightful, and I was reminded of how, just like in previous weeks, I've felt like all these speakers, whether they are tenured professors or industry people, are all very well-spoken as well as knowledgable. From a personal perspective, there's a lot to consider when applying to grad programs, but if I can matched up with advisors like these speakers, I think I'll be in a good spot (by the way, if you're a professor of mine reading this due to some of the emails I sent out recently, hello!).

 - 1:30 - 4:00 PM: The next step in the semantic guidance approach is to work on solving the problem of group fairness. My idea is to use the results of the gender and race classifier I was working with previously (DeepFace), especially the classification confidences, to weight the guidance of each photo. At its current state, if we give a guidance prompt like "middle eastern" to get the people in an image to look more middle eastern, every person will become more middle eastern. Consequently, I'm hoping that if I can use the "average" confidences (in terms of race and gender) to support the semantic guidance across an entire image, the overall output can be more fair than the original generated one. (Note that the guidance is sort of inversely proportional to overall confidence -- if the classifier is very sure that the people in the image are white, then ideally the generated image will have greater representation of other races). In the afternoon, I started setting up (using previous code I've written) a pipeline to generate an image, classify the people in the image, get the gender/race confidences, and use that to "guide" a more fair image -- I'm hoping the results will be successful but at the very least, I'm happy that I'm beginning to work on an approach that I'm much more enthusiastic/excited about compared to before.

 After research, I went down to the second floor to pick up a check for my last few weeks of research. I then walked back to the dorm, felt quite tired, and proceeded to take a much-longer-than-anticipated nap. I had originally planned to head to the pool after research but I didn't think I would make it back to the Student Union by 7 if I did do that, so I ended up going for a pretty breezy 2 mile run around campus. Grabbing some CFA from STAMP, I went back, ate dinner, worked on some CodeForces (I finished up 1850H, which means that I've now "solved all" -- missing A, B, and C which are typically much easier-- of the problems from the most recent Div 4, which is the first contest I've fully solved), and did some laundry to close out the night.

 ### <u>Day 50 (July 24th)</u>

Week 8 Day 2

 - 8:30 - 9:00 AM: Back to the morning swims I go! I was really not feeling it this morning -- despite the nap I took yesterday evening and a solid 8ish hours of sleep, I was feeling tired and my arms felt like jelly. I managed to push through for 25ish minutes of swimming and finished with around 40 laps.

 - 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Continuing my work from yesterday, my goal today was to build on the Semantic Guidance approach using results from the DeepFace gender/race classifier. After taking some time to set up the relevant analysis (reading the classifier results and storing it in a dictionary, then looping through the dictionary to get the average confidence), I took a while to think about how I could weight the guidance based on the average confidence. My first idea, however, turned out hilariously bad, with the resulting images getting completely changed by the edit guidance weights/hyperparameters. I had a good laugh with XG, SS, and AF about how bad the results were, and then went back to thinking about how I could make the guidance a bit better (more thinking is needed on this front).

 - 1:15 - 4:00 PM: In the afternoon session, I built on my work from the morning. After a bit more experimentation and generation yielded slightly better but not by much results (images were a bit more clear than the morning but the faces/people looked nothing like the original images), I decided to refrain from guiding race and gender with prompting and instead focus on just guiding gender (male or female). Using similar ideas with the average confidence, I generated a few slightly better images. LH joined us in our conference room, and so SS, LH, and I got sidetracked talking about grad school expectations, life, and applications -- these conversations, though they kind of distract us from research for a bit, are in my opinion really insightful and rewarding, and I'm glad that they are happy to just chat so openly and honestly. This is one of the aspects I like the most about an REU compared to research at Swarthmore -- since we all live close together, are part of the same program, and come from different backgrounds/schools, it's easier to have a honest conversation with different perspectives, and I'm really grateful for that. In terms of research, I think the SEGA approach I've been working on still has some serious promise, which is great.

 I've been feeling quite tired after research, so I mainly relaxed until 6, when I decided to go do laundry, grab CFA for dinner, and then move my clothes from the washer to the dryer. I came back, did some quick CodeForces, reading, and more relaxing. I like hanging out with the other REU students but it's always good to have some days of solo time to decompress. A few of us were initially planning to watch a movie at night but LH had a headache, so we'll have to wait another day for that.
