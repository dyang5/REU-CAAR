## Week 3

### <u>Day 15 (June 19th)</u>

Today was Juneteenth, so we had the day off. This helped me relax a bit more over the weekend, but I know there will be plenty to do tomorrow as well. I went for a typical morning swim -- though I went near 10:00 today so there was a lot more people (including some Masters Swimmers).  After a nice workout, I played some tennis with AF before grabbing a Ramen lunch with AF as well. Work wise, I spent most of the day working on Ranom Numbers (an 1800 rated CodeForces problem). This took me a few hours (the initial solution I came up with, that I was debugging for a quite a while, had a flaw in it and was incorrect). For dinner, SS, AF, DS, and I went to The Spot Mini, a nice Poke Bowl place nearby. I came back, did laundry, debugged my CodeForces problem some more, and finally got it. Despite having to look at the Editorial, this was a nice end to the extra rest day.

Tomorrow, my research group will discuss what our next steps are and what we want to share with our advisor in a meeting on Wednesday.
