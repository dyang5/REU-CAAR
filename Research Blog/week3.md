## Week 3

### <u>Day 15 (June 19th)</u>

Week 3, Day 1
 - Today was Juneteenth, so we had the day off. This helped me relax a bit more over the weekend, but I know there will be plenty to do tomorrow as well. I went for a typical morning swim -- though I went near 10:00 today so there was a lot more people (including some Masters Swimmers).  After a nice workout, I played some tennis with AF before grabbing a Ramen lunch with AF as well. Work wise, I spent most of the day working on Ranom Numbers (an 1800 rated CodeForces problem). This took me a few hours (the initial solution I came up with, that I was debugging for a quite a while, had a flaw in it and was incorrect). For dinner, SS, AF, DS, and I went to The Spot Mini, a nice Poke Bowl place nearby. I came back, did laundry, debugged my CodeForces problem some more, and finally got it. Despite having to look at the Editorial, this was a nice end to the extra rest day.

Tomorrow, my research group will discuss what our next steps are and what we want to share with our advisor in a meeting on Wednesday.

### <u>Day 16 (June 19th)</u>

Surprise Second Meeting Day

 - 8:30 - 9:00 AM: Morning swim to mark the "official" start of the third week of REU-CAAR. Good 20 minute-ish workout -- I still want to get out of bed a bit earlier to get this up to 25-30 minutes each day.

 - 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM: After finding out that our Wednesday meeting time we did last week was booked for this week, I had to set up a last-minute meeting change; my group decided that it would be best to meet tonight -- making today our all-important prep day. In the morning, we focused on summarizing our work from the last week and formalizing the ideas we had been thinking about. This was a really productive morning; we were actually able to fine-tune one of our "group fairness" (trying to make the output of a diffusion model more "fair" in terms of gender balance) more clearly, and define differentiable loss functions (which are necessary for gradient descent/weight updating in neural networks).

 - 12:00 - 1:30 PM: We listened to a talk on "Chess Playing Computers" (the history of AI in Chess and the advances over time) by Clyde Kruskal, who is an Associate Professor of CS at UMD. Crazily enough, I learned that he is the nephew of [Joseph Kruskal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kruskal), who made the [Kruskal MST Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm). He discussed Monte Carlo Tree Search, Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and a number of other advances I had seen from my AI class at Swarthmore. I found it quite funny how energetic and quick-witted he was -- just like Bill, these older professors have a fun and unique energy to them, which I definitely want to have if I get old in academia. Another cool fact is that his father was apparently the first person to play against an AI in chess, which is absolutely crazy.

 - 1:30 - 4:00 PM: My research group continued gathering our thoughts and prepping for our meeting with our advisor. After forming a Meeting Abstract and aggregating our work/notes, SS had the idea to make a presentation. Though my group reluctantly agreed, this was actually a great idea as it's much easier to demonstrate our main idea through pictures rather than words. Also, given the remote (Zoom) format of our meetings, it definitely makes it easier for our advisor to follow along. We aggregated our thoughts and divided the slides into presentation points. I thought today was overall quite productive and it gave me good confidence heading into the meeting.

 I was super tired after research so I took a quick nap afterwards. For dinner, I grabbed some CFA -- there were so many people in STAMP today due to another session of New Student Orientation -- before heading back to my dorm to look over my slides.

 - 8:00 - 9:00 PM: Research Meeting Time! Just like last week, AF, SS, and I Zoomed in from the basement while XG Zoomed from home. This time, to avoid all working on the same computer, we put in our Airpods and decided to make it so only one of us would remain unmuted at a time. Though there was a bit of an echo (since we heard each other in person before our Airpods would pick it up on Zoom), this turned out to be a great arrangement. 

  > Content wise, I think the meeting went really well. The presentation format allowed us to explain our ideas much more clearly. At first, our advisor was asking many questions regarding our approach, but all of them were important points and helped us think about how to generalize our approach (our notion of "fair representation" is mainly gender-based, how will we extend this to other demographic groups/sensitive attributes?); I think these questions also helped us explain our idea more clearly to her. After each of our slides, she would ask us a few questions and we would clarify/expand on our solutions. There is a lot of details here, so I will leave them out and add them as we make progress on our project. I was particularly happy about the reception to our loss function definitions (we want to both minimize what we call "fairness loss" -- which attempts to mitigate the gender bias by getting the proportion of males generated to be as close to 0.5 as possible -- and "confidence loss" -- which forces images to be clearly male-defined or female-defined and not a "blob"/androgynous); she was excited that we had explained the mathematical reasoning behind our definitions. We actually just worked on this idea this morning, so it was great to see that come to fruition and be well-received. Overall, there are a bunch of avenues to explore code-wise (this will be difficult especially for me, but it's good to have more to learn and work on), but it seems like our next steps will be to set up an "Experiment Plan" (determining what dataset(s) to use, what models to run, what scripts we will need, etc.). Our advisor wants to check in with us about this before we run anything, which is really great as well as she'll be there to give us more guidance.

 Overall, today was great -- meeting wise, the feedback seemed positive and we were really happy about that. We also have more direction; rather than trying to formulate more ideas, we have a few that we are hopefully able to build on and test out more!
