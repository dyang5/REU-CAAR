## Week 7

### <u>Day 43 (July 17th)</u>

Week 7, Day 1

 - 8:30 - 9:00 AM: Wow. It's week 7 already, which is crazy. Time is dwindling -- I hope we get some cool research results to present in just under three weeks. Instead of getting out for my Monday morning swim, I played it safe and waited for AG, the grad lead for REU-CAAR, to bring all the isolating students COVID Test Kits (which is quite nice of him). I tested Negative and so that meant I could finally get back to work at IRB. I broughout out my mask just to be safe as well.

 - 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM: To start off the research week, I wanted to work on testing the results from the generated images (from our diffusion models) on the DeepFace classifier. After some experimentation with prompting and comparing the results to work from my other group members, I generated 15 images for each of the four types of prompts (portrait/group images of doctors/firefighters) and proceeded to hand-label the portrait images. I then used the image to classification pipeline that I had written from previous weeks, modified some of the code, and ran it on the generated images. To analyze the results, I would need to hand-label the images (since they are generated and are not part of a labeled dataset). After some discussion with my group, I ended up doing this for the portrait images before heading to lunch.

 - 12:00 - 1:30 PM: We had another one of our weekly Monday REU lunch talks. Today Bill gave a talk on [The Hat Problem](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/REU/hatstalk.pdf). I had seen this problem before but did not remember the strategy (and I also had not seen the many extensions proposed by Bill); overall, I found the talk quite enjoyable and it was great to think mathematically/problem-solve for the first time in a while. I definitely want to ask Bill whether I can present a version of this to professors at Swarthmore, or even present it as part of the IMC (Interactive Math Colloquium) Club I run, since I very much enjoyed this talk!

- 1:30 - 4:00 PM: I quite enjoyed Bill's Hat Talk so I spent some time afterwards discussing the proofs (especially the infinite hat, 2 colors and infinite hat, at most 1 error cases) with AF and SS (XG, our final group member, is going to be working remotely this week). We talked a bit about the [Axiom of Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice), our thoughts on it, as well as some resulting paradoxes including Banachâ€“Tarski (the Axiom of Choice is used in one of the proofs discussed by Bill). Afterwards, I ended up discussing the general research plan (what everyone was working on, potential limitations of our research and what we can do to address them, and what we can do next to get a solid research project before the REU ends) with my group members AF and SS. I think this was really productive -- at times, I feel like I've only been working on a small part of the pipeline, but it's important to realize that the general fairness process we are trying to build relies on many different small but essential parts. AF and I also tried to reason through mathematical foundation behind a Latent Diffusion Model paper SS was trying to read through, to some success. I didn't get too much done outside of this group discussion, but I feel like having these sorts of discussions is really necessary to get everyone aligned and on the same page and to build a solid working dynamic, so I was quite happy with that. 

After research, I ended up relaxing a bit before heading out to "play badminton" with ZF, AG, and SS. It turns out there were only 3 badminton racquets, and since I didn't want them to have to rotate, I ended up playing Racquetball on my own for 30ish minutes. Afterwards, I waited around and watched them and others play badminton. This ended up taking much longer than anticipated, which I was okay with since I mainly was on my phone after a while, but it meant that we had to jog to CFA before it closed at 7. Obviously, then, since we ordered right before closing, the food wasn't as good as normal. Oh well.

Outside of research, I've been waiting for my monitor to arrive (it was supposed to arrive yesterday but the delivery didn't go through), and it hasn't arrived yet today, either, which kind of sucks. I'm really looking forward to a better setup to hopefully allow me to be more productive and work easier in my room. I've also been waiting to hear from the [Young Mathematicians Conference](https://ymc.osu.edu/), a math conference I applied to using my work from last year, so fingers crossed on that front!
