Week 9 Day 1: 1.5 to Go

- 8:30 - 9:00 AM: Week 9, here we go. Though there are technically two weeks left in the program, it's really closer to 1.5 considering we have our final presentation next Wednesday. This means go time in terms of finalizing our research process/presentations (we have a practice presentation on August 7th and a final meeting sometime August 3rd with our advisor as well). With my stomach problems, I've been avoiding any heavy exercise -- so no swimming or running for a while -- but today I wanted to go out and get some exercise with an "easy run." This ended up working out fine, since I got an extra thirty minutes of sleep that I would have used on the walking commute to and from the gym if I had gone to the pool instead. I made it back in time for a shower at my typical time before heading out for research in the morning.

- 10:00 - 10:40 AM: Today's research schedule was a bit weird. AF, XG, SS, and I congregated in our normal room, discussed general approaches (and XG gave me some valuable advice about how to fix the CUDA out of memory errors I've been getting -- instead of requesting extra memory, request a "better" GPU), what we should have done before the next meeting with our advisor, and presentation plans. This was a productive discussion, but it was cut short because we were to head to REU talks by students from Salisbury in the nearby AV Williams Building. 

- 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM: The Salisbury REU program students gave talks on Homologies, Using Machine Learning to Study Tumors, ML for Oyster Classification, Parallel Matching (similar to Gale-Shapley), Social Network Study, and Deep Learning for Satellite Imagery. They were all pretty good, especially for work done over a short summer program. I thought it was pretty funny that the Oyster Project also used YOLOv8, an object detector that we used for face detection in our project. 

After the talks, a full room of nearly 100 students, faculty, and parents were anxious for lunch... with the catering yet to arrive. 

- 12:30 - 2:30 PM: Instead of taking a break for lunch, we jumped into the next round of activities, which included Grad Program Information from UMD CS, AMSC (Applied Math, Scientific Computing), as well as a panel of Grad Students sharing their experiences. I learned some useful information for my application -- including that CS seems to match students to advisors during the application process whereas AMSC is much more lax about selecting an advisor due to the breadth of options available. In this sense, I learned that for my CS applications, I will need to be much more tailored to the area I want to study, whereas for AMSC (which I am pretty interested in), I can speak more broadly about my background and why I might be a good fit.

Somewhere along the line, the Panera lunch came in, with everyone running over to secure their food. I was already sitting closer to the back, so I managed to snag a box lunch without pushing or shoving, but I think the lunch process could have been a bit orderely -- I'm not a big fan of the people who push and shove to get their top lunch choice, especially when there are so many people and, as I'd pointed out, likely not enough lunches. I felt particularly bad for the Salisbury students, who were sitting in the front due to their presentations; many of them did not end up getting a box lunch and instead went to IRB or Panda Express to get some food.

- 2:30 - 4:00 PM: With the REU activities and grad panel, today was a much shorter research day than anticipated. When we came back from the talks, I got to work trying to test my code on a better GPU -- I definitely got more images generated than normal, which was great. One of the main things we'll need to consider is how to get better edit weights -- currently, with the approach I'm using, a set of male dominated images will become female dominated after editing; however, I'm trying to get it much closer to a 50-50 split. I suppose that I could just select a few of the images to edit based on the overall distribution, but this doesn't seem very elegant as a fix, though I guess that could be said about the SEGA approach as a whole.

After research, I went straight to Today's Hair to get a haircut -- which was quite needed. Heading back to the dorms, I talked with DS a bit inside before deciding to head out on another run (2 mile one just like in the morning) to get some more exercise in on a nice day. I ended up coming back, only for ML and AB to be in the shower cue, so I promptly went out to the dining hall with LH for dinner. We ended up having a good conversation, which reminded me how nice it is to be talking with other REU students :) I came back and showered, and then we met up with AB, SS, DS, and XG to watch the movie "No Hard Feelings." I got some CodeForces done along the way (with an extra hour of debugging needed after the movie) and unfortunately also ended up losing my keys (which is not good -- I got a spare for now but will need to find them. I do think they're somewhere in the suite though which should limit potential spots) before calling it a night. I think I'll definitely need to work extra hard this week to get the presentation going and to prepare a good summary of the work we've done -- tomorrow will be a big day on this front.
